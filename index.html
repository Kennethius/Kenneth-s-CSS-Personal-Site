          <h3>HTML & CSS Coding</h3>
          <p>I started learning how to code as a student of Journalism in South Africa. I took on web design as a main career focus at the University of Toronto in a joint program with Centennial College. Successfully graduated with a New Media
            degree in 17'. I wanted to be able to build my own websites that reflected my interests. I gained a wealth of experience working with clients completing projects from beginning to end.</p>

          <h3>Photography and Photo Editing</h3>
          <p>I started playing around with a camera when I was was in high school taking photographs of landscapes and learning how to edit them in my spare time. I fine-tuned my skills through my experience with working with clients and receiving
            positive and negative feedback.</p>
